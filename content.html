    <title>Get Photos. Get Laid. Get a Job.</title>

 <h1>Get a job. Get laid. Covers all the bases, right?</h1>

<h2>It's 2015. You need a LinkedIn portrait to get hired. You need a Grindr/Tinder/FarmersOnly.com pic to get a date. And that selfie you took in the mirror at a bar isn't going to cut it.</h2>

<h3>So here's the simple deal. $50, you get a professional shot for your job hunt, and a less professional shot for your man hunt. In, out, you get your photos the same day, all rights released.</h3>

<p>Want extra shots to pad out Tinder? $15 a pop. Want <em>just</em> a job pic or a dating pic? $35.</p>
