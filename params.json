You need a Grindr/Tinder/FarmersOnly.com pic to get a date. And that selfie you took in the mirror at a bar isn't going to cut it.\r\n\r\n### So here's the simple deal. $50, you get a professional shot for your job hunt, and a less professional shot for your man hunt. In, out, you get your photos the same day, all rights released.\r\n\r\nWant extra shots to pad out Tinder? $15 a pop. Want *just* a job pic or a dating pic? $35.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
